        <a>SUPERHOT is the first person shooter where time moves only when you move. No regenerating health bars. No conveniently 
            placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned,
            grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.</a>
